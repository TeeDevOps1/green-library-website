### Background Scenerio
As part of a develpment team tasked to enhance  Greenwood Community Library. My team is tasked with enhancing the website for the library. This includes the following sections: Home, About_us, Events and Contact_us. 
We are are to add Book Reviews sections and also update the events page.

Here are the steps i took to accomplish this project.

1. Create a Repository on Github
2. Name it green-library-website

3. Initialized the Readme file 
4. I cloned the Repository to my local machine.

From the main branch, I added files/Pages which included contents that served as the existing codebase for the website.
These files include: 
* home.html
* About_us.html
* Events.html
* Contact_us.html
